<p>Recently the morning radio talk show known as The Breakfast Club posed a curious question about the importance smartphones play in our everyday lives.
   They asked would you choose your smartphone over your significant other?
   All three radio hosts would talk about it and they would also be taking phone calls from listeners about it and the results were pretty interesting.
    Every single woman that called in to the radio station said that they would take their significant other over their smartphone and without any hesitation.
   Every man that called in however said the opposite, that they would rather have their phone because they couldn’t survive without all the various features.
   When you think about it for the average person their smartphone is their connection to their friends, their watch, their alarm clock, their calendar, their flashlight and so on.
    All three hosts would eventually pick their significant other over their smartphones but the common understanding was that it wasn’t an easy decision and that we all should probably take a deeper look into what we really value.
