<p>         If you havenâ€™t heard about the game until dawn, it is something you should definitely look up. The best way that I can describe this game is that it is a revved up high quality upgrade of the telltale game The Walking Dead. To start off, the graphics are excellent. Beautiful backgrounds and like life characters help the narrative to have a real movie type feel to it. The way the jump scares are set up through the game it feels like you really get inside of this horror film and many of the decisions that you will face are as simple as be quick and brash or be slow and cautious. So if you are constantly annoyed at how horror movie characters act you have a chance to remedy that. Many simple effects such as swiping the touch pad on the PlayStation controller when opening a phone lock screen, or holding the controller still when you are trying to hide, help to make this game incredibly immersive. I would definitely look into this game if you want a true immersive experience.
