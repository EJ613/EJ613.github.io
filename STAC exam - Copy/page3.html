<p>During a class this semester in IASC 1F01 I stumbled across a trailer for a new app that uses augmented reality. It’s called Pokemon go, due to the popularity of Pokemon there is already a lot of buzz surrounding this new app. The trailer also helps to generate the buzz however I feel like the commercial is incredibly misleading and I feel like the game has a high chance to be a dud. The commercial features visuals of people finding Pokemon in various locations as well as large Pokemon battles. However as it stands right now there are no talks to involve google glass or some type of wearable with the game, which would mean the only time you would see Pokemon is through the phone screen. This definitely takes away from the overall hype that the trailer provides however I feel like Pokemon’s incredibly large fan base will love the game regardless. They will play the game and love it just because it’s a Pokémon game. I personally feel like it won’t come close to it’s expectations however I would not be mad at all if I am proven wrong.
